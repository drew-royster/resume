I started my career in QA while in school, pivoted to devops and then pivoted again to full stack development. Lately I've been working with llm's to add some stochastic intelligence to applications where they come in handy, typically where a human being needs to interface with a computer. I built a group networking application for https://newfounding.com and https://exitgroup.us where they can search for their members in natural language. It uses function calling and vector embeddings to allow location and semantic similarity search. A live example is on my website https://drewroyster.com where you can find the closest match of relevant experience related to your query. It's running locally in the browser with no external calls and a great example of what's possible on the edge.
